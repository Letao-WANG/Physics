### Stern-Gerlach experiment

![Stern-Gerlach_schematic](Images\Stern-Gerlach_schematic.png)

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}(x,y,z) = B_x(x,z)\hat{i}+B_z(x,z)\hat{k}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}(x,y,z) = 0
$$

We also have $\nabla \times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}(x,y,z) = 0$, this implies that $\partial_x B_x = - \partial_z B_z$


$$
\left. \partial_xB_z\right|_{x=0} = 0
$$
Finally, when a function is even in $x$, it can be expanded as a power series in $x^2$. Hence, when we take a derivative, it is proportional to $x$. This must vanish when $x=0$, so (3).
