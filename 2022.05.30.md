## Classical Stern-Gerlach in detail

### Forces and Torques

$\overrightarrow{\mu}(t)$: **effective needle** that represents the current loop, fixed-length, and can change its direction as a function of time.

The magnetic field is a constant, it does not change in time, it is spatially changing, so we have:
$$
\vec{\mathbf{F}}(t) = \vec{\nabla} \Big(\ \vec{\mu}(t)\ \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}}(x,y,z)\ \Big)
$$
So the force is constant if the projection of the effective needle does not change in time.

### Torque

Magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}$  has a magnitude given by the current times of the area, $\mu = I\mathbf{S}$.

Or $e\frac{v}{2\pi\tau} \times \pi r^{2}$ ; the first factor is the charge, the second gives the rate of the charge is moving around the circle and the third is the area of the circle. And because of $\vec{\mathbf{L}} = rm_ev \hat{k}$, so we have:
$$
\vec{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} evr\hat{k} = \frac{e}{2m_e} \times m_evr\hat{k} = \frac{e}{2m_e}\vec{\mathbf{L}}
$$
Because of $\frac{d\vec{\mathbf{L}}}{dt} = \vec \tau$  and $\vec \tau = \vec \mu \times \vec{\mathbf{B}}$, so we have:
$$
\dot{\vec{\mu}} = \frac{|e|}{2m_e}\vec{\mathbf{B}} \times \vec \mu
$$
This formula used the fact that the electric charge is negative to switch the order of the cross product.
